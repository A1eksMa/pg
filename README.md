# DockerCompose PostgreSQL
## Key Steps to Make Your Web Server Secure:
### Create strong passwords
### Generate an SSH key pair
### Keep your server updated
```bash
apt update && apt upgrade -y
```
To set up a cron task to run updates at 24:00 every day:
```bash
# Open the crontab editor
crontab -e
```
This will open the crontab editor in the default text editor. Add the following line to the file:
```bash
0 0 * * * apt update && apt upgrade -y
```
Save and exit the editor.

**Script**

```bash
#!/bin/bash
apt update && apt upgrade -y
(crontab -l ; echo "0 0 * * * apt update && apt upgrade -y") | crontab -
```
This command appends the new cron job to the existing crontab file
